# Privacy Policy

BUGOUT makes an effort to minimize the amount of
data that we store about you, the user.

## Client ID

In order to operate the game, we generate a large,
random number (called a Client ID). This is used to
identify you over the course of multiple sessions of
gameplay. We used a standard V4 UUID to represent
this number. It's just a number, and doesn't relate
to who you are in terms of physical location or human
identity, etc.

The Client ID is stored in your web browser, in our
server's database, and in our server's log files.

You can remove the Client ID from your web browser
by clearing your browser's local storage.

The Client ID may be present in our server database
for up to 24 hours after a user interacts with our
system. After 24 hours, it disappears from our database
automatically. The Client ID may be present in log
files stored on our server for a limited period of time.

## IP Address Logging

We store your IP address inside our web server logs for a
limited period of time. This is a standard security practice.

## Going Forward

In the future, we may opt to provide capabilities that
require creating and storing additional data for each
user. This includes, but is not limited to, such features
as allowing users to choose a name, or participate in a
leaderboard.
