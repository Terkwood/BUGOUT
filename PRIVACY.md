# Privacy Policy

BUGOUT currently seeks to minimize the amount of
data that we store about you, the user.

In order to operate the game, we generate a large,
random number (called a Client ID), and store that
in your web browser. This is used to identify you
over the course of multiple sessions of gameplay.
You can destroy this data by clearing your browser's
local storage.

The Client ID may be present in our server database
for up to 24 hours after a user interacts with our
system. After 24 hours, it disappears from our server
logs automatically.

Additionally, we store your IP address inside our web
server logs for a limited period of time. This is
a standard security practice.

## Going Forward

In the future, we may opt to provide capabilities that
require creating and storing additional data for each
user. This includes, but is not limited to, such features
as allowing users to choose a name, or participate in a
leaderboard.
