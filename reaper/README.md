# BUGOUT reaper service

This service is designed to shut down the expensive
compute host used by the JVM services.  It waits
for user activity on kafka to die down, ensures
that an appropriate amount of time has passed,
deems the system inactive, then issues an AWS stop
instance request.

## HOW IT WORKS

_TODO we should describe the .env vars_.  that would be helpful.
