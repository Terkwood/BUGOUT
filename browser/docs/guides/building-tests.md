# Building & Tests

## Building

Building Sabaki requires [Node.js 6.2.x or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm. First, clone Sabaki:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki
$ cd Sabaki
~~~

### Desktop version

Install the dependencies of Sabaki using npm:

~~~
$ npm install
~~~

Sabaki uses webpack to bundle all files into one single file. For development use the following command to create bundles automatically while you edit files:

~~~
$ npm run watch
~~~

To start Sabaki while in development, use the start command:

~~~
$ npm start
~~~

You can build Sabaki binaries with Electron by using:

~~~
$ npm run build
~~~

This will bundle everything and create a folder with the executables in `Sabaki/dist`. To create installers/archives you can use one of the following instructions depending on the target OS:

* `$ npm run dist:win32` for Windows 32-bit
* `$ npm run dist:win64` for Windows 64-bit
* `$ npm run dist:linux` for Linux 32-bit and 64-bit
* `$ npm run dist:macos` for macOS 64-bit

### Web version

Checkout the `web` branch and install the dependencies for the web version:

```
$ git checkout web
$ npm install
```

To build Sabaki, use one of the following build instructions:

* `$ npm run watch` creates a human-readable build and watches code for changes
* `$ npm run build` creates a minified version

This creates a `bundle.js` file. To run Sabaki, simply open `Sabaki/index.html` in a modern web browser, preferably Chrome.

## Tests

Make sure you have the master branch checked out since there are no test in the web branch. To run the (currently very limited) unit tests, use:

~~~
$ npm test
~~~
