# Create Themes

Themes are just a fancy way to pack a [userstyle](userstyle-tutorial.md) and its assets into a single file that can be redistributed.

## Structure

First, create a userstyle. A userstyle consists of a CSS file `styles.css` and other assets such as images, fonts, or other CSS files. Take a look at [Shudan's documentation](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Shudan/tree/master/docs#styling) to see how to change board and stone images in a userstyle. Put the files in a folder, say `theme`, and make sure no other files or folders are in there.

## `package.json`

Create a text file named `package.json` inside `theme`. Its structure is compatible with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json), but Sabaki will only use the following fields:

* `name` - All lowercase, no spaces, dashes allowed
* `description` *(optional)*
* `version` - In the form of `x.x.x`
* `author` *(optional)*
* `homepage` *(optional)*
* `main` - The CSS file to include in Sabaki, usually `styles.css`

For example:

~~~json
{
    "name": "my-theme",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "main": "styles.css"
}
~~~

## Packing

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed. If you don't have `asar` installed already, run:

	$ npm install asar -g

To pack your userstyle into a theme, run the following command:

	$ asar pack ./theme ./theme.asar

`theme.asar` will be created and is ready for distribution. It can be installed in Preferences.
