# Userstyle Tutorial

Some Go players are quite picky when it comes to stones and board textures. I'm not saying Sabaki's textures look the best or are realistic, but I daresay they're quite good. However, if you really have to, you can actually change them using userstyles.

Using userstyles is an easy way to change Sabaki's appearance without having to replace any important files and without having the changes reverted with the next update.

## Determine `styles.css` location

First, determine where Sabaki saves its settings:

- `%APPDATA%\Sabaki` on Windows
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Sabaki` or `~/.config/Sabaki` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support/Sabaki` on macOS

Inside the folder there's a file named `styles.css`. Any CSS statement inside this file will be loaded when Sabaki starts up. It can be helpful to [open the developer tools](debugging.md) to look at the DOM.

Take a look at [Shudan's documentation](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Shudan/tree/master/docs#styling) to see how to change board and stone images.
