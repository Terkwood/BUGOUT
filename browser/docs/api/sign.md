# Sign Object

Sabaki uses integers to denote the colors black and white. `1` corresponds to black (black stones or black player), whereas `-1` corresponds to white (white stones or white player). `0` is used to represent neutral color. The advantage of this encoding is that we can literally multiply a color by `-1` to get the enemy color.
