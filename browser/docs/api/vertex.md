# Vertex Object

A vertex object `v` is an array of length 2. The first entry encodes the column (left to right) starting from `0`, and the second entry the row (top to bottom) starting from `0`.

Both values should be integers. Values can be negative as well.

# Signed Vertex Object

A signed vertex object `v` is an array of integers of length 3. The first two entries form a vertex object. The last entry is a [sign](sign.md).
